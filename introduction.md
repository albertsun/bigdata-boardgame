## Introduction

_Big Data: The Board Game_ is a game of linking fragmented data points, obtaining personally identifiable information, wild accusations, and storytelling.

You play as an aspiring Data Startup, ready to change the world by improving omnichannel analytics across the consumer data ecosystem. You buy datasets in a series of real-time auctions which can contain the personally identifiable information about consumers which your data scientists can use to build micro-targeted profiles on individuals. The more you collect on these consumers, the easier it is to tell stories about them.

But you’re not just a company; you’re also a person. As you go about your life, you produce data points, data points which are rolled up into data sets that are sold to companies and campaigns without your input. Often these data points, when put together, can create an inaccurate or incomplete portrayal of who you are and will be used in ways you never intended.

As a Data Startup you’re trying to tell stories about other players to sell them things or make decisions about them. And as a person, you’re just trying to go about your life without too much intrusion. Can you navigate the complexities of the multidimensional consumer data ecosystem?
