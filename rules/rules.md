# The Rules

_For 5 Real-Time, Co-Located Players_

_Ages 13 and up. For players under the age of 13, please visit our COPPA compliance for a parent or legal guardian to provide verifiable consent._

### Overview

The goal of the game is to successfully use data to tell a revealing stories about another player. Success of each story is judged by the non-involed players.

The game proceeds in rounds of buying datasets to reveal other player's personally identifiable information, and using that information to tell stories.

Each dataset card that goes up for auction has corresponding personally identifiable information cards. When a player, buys a dataset at auction, every other player who holds a matching datapoint must reveal it to the new owner of the dataset.

The game goes on until datasets have been auctioned off or someone flips the table in a fit of rage. In the case of the latter, that person is to be referred to as Richard Stallman for the rest of the night.

### Setup

1. Set the board out on the table. You are very good at following directions.
2. Shuffle each of the 3 sets of cards. Place the story and dataset cards on the board and set the PII cards aside to draw from. 
3. Each player chooses a dataset claim token, draws 5 Personal Identification Cards to represent their persona and mines 12 Ƀitcoins. They are also given a data warehouse (notebook) to record the data they collect about other players.

Now you’re ready to play!

&nbsp;

### Each Round

#### Auction and Data Collection

1. Flip over a dataset card to be auctioned off.
2. Any interested players shout out their bid amount while placing the corresponding amount of Bitcoin on the game board. New bids must be higher than the current highest bid. The auction is to proceed as quickly as possible. 
3. The winner takes the dataset card they've bought, places a claim token on the corresponding spot on the board, and pays the amount of their bid.
4. The process is repeated for four datasets.
5. Going clockwise around the board, the winner of each dataset auction asks if any of the other players have a PII card from their winning dataset.
6. Players with any matching PII cards must show the card to the winner of the auction, and the winner records the findings in their Data Warehouse (spiral notebook).
7. There may be datasets purchased that don’t correspond to PII cards in other players’ hands. Tough luck. Data is messy and sometimes full of expensive mistakes.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### Storytelling

1. A story card is drawn and the players must decide if they can tell a story based on the information they have about other players. 
2. Each player places a hand in the middle and simultaneously reveals a thumbs up or thumbs down to show whether or not they plan to tell a story that round. 
3. The first player to tell a story begins by saying which player they intend to tell a story about. 
4. The storyteller then uses the personal data they have acquired about that person to tell a convincing story based on the story card prompt. 
5. The subject of the story has a chance to refute the story based on the other PII in their hand. 
6. The other three players then vote using the thumbs up/thumbs down method to accept or reject the refutation. 
7. If the subject can not refute the story or their refutation is not accepted, the storyteller earns a win token for the board and 5 Ƀ coins (Bitcoins). The subject gets a fail token.
8. If the subject can successfully refute the story, they get a win token but no additional Ƀ coins (Bitcoins). The storyteller gets a fail token.

Like web scraping, other players listening in to gather data is fair game.

After everyone who chose to tell a story does so, it's on to selling and opening data.

&nbsp;

#### Selling and Opening Data

At this point, players may opt to sell their PII to the bank or the owner of the corresponding dataset for additional Ƀitcoin.

##### Right of First Refusal

_Only after the first round_

A player who has previously purchased a dataset may ask if any players have subsequently received new PII cards from their purchased datasets. They must offer a fair price for each card. It is up to the holder of the PII card to accept or reject the offer.

Subsequently, if someone wishes to sell a PII card from a sold dataset, it must first be offered to the holder of that dataset card, before being sold to another player at a negotiated price, or released as Open Data (below).

##### Open Data

A player may opt to release their PII as Open Data. That player announces the contents of their card and place it face up on the table in front of them.

Releasing a PII card as Open Data is always worth 3 Ƀ coins.

##### Draw new PII cards

At the end of each round, life goes on and each player draws 2 additional PII cards to add to their hand.

&nbsp;


*Play additional rounds until all datasets have been sold*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## End of the Game

1. When all datasets have been bought, there is a final round of data collection and storytelling.
2. At the end, a player's score is their number of win tokens minus their number of fail tokens.
3. The player with the highest score wins. 
4. Everyone else loses. But at least they get easy photo sharing!
