## Introduction

_Big Data: The Board Game_ is a game of linking fragmented data points, obtaining personally identifiable information, wild accusations, and storytelling.

You play as an aspiring Data Startup, ready to change the world by improving omnichannel analytics across the consumer data ecosystem. You buy datasets in a series of real-time auctions. The datasets can contain the personally identifiable information about consumers which your data scientists can use to build micro-targeted profiles of individuals. The more data you collect on these consumers, the easier it is to tell stories about them.

But you’re not just a corporation; you’re a person too. As you go about your life you produce data points, data points which are rolled up into datasets that are sold to companies and campaigns without your input. When these data points are put together they will be used in ways you never intended and can create an inaccurate or incomplete portrayal of who you are.

As a Data Startup you’re trying to tell stories about other players to sell them things or make decisions about them. But as a person, you’re just trying to go about your life without too much intrusion. Can you navigate the complexities of the multidimensional consumer data ecosystem?
