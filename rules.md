## Background:

Big Data: The Board Game is a game of linking fragmented data points, obtaining personally identifiable information, and storytelling.

You play as an aspiring Data Startup, ready to change the world by improving omnichannel analytics across the consumer data ecosystem. You buy datasets in a series of real-time auctions which can contain the personally identifiable information about consumers which your data scientists can use to build micro-targeted profiles on individuals. The more you collect on these consumers, the easier it is to tell stories about them.

But you’re not just a company; you’re also a person. As you go about your life, you produce data points, data points which are rolled up into data sets that are sold to companies and campaigns without your input. Often these data points, when put together, can create an inaccurate or incomplete portrayal of who you are and will be used in ways you never intended.

As a Data Startup you’re trying to tell stories about other players to sell them things or make decisions about them. But as a person you’re trying to live a simple 

Get ready to Disrupt Everything! 

## General Overview

Each player is given a starting set of 5 randomized Personally Identifiable Information cards (PII) to represent their person (Consumer) and 12Ƀ (bitcoins) with which to buy data sets.

The game is played in a series of rounds consisting of a dataset auction, collecting data from other players, and telling stories about the other players. At the end of each round, each player collects two new PII cards, and a new round begins. This continues until all data sets have been auctioned off.

Buying data sets gets you access to any matching Personally Identifiable Information from other players’ hands. Players with PII cards that match your data set must show you the matching cards.

Players are given the opportunity to tell a story about another player, using the information they have collected about that other player. The story may be refuted if the player the story is about has a PII card that contradicts the story.

A successfully told story means a WIN and 5Ƀ for the storyteller and a FAIL for the consumer. A successfully defended story means a WIN for the consumer and a FAIL for the storyteller.

The game is played until the end of the round where all data sets have been auctioned off or someone flips the table in a fit of rage. In the case of the latter, that person is to be referred to as Richard Stallman for the rest of the night.

The winner is whichever player who has the greatest number of WINs minus their FAILs.

### How to Collect Data

Auction - Buying other players’ PII en masse. 

Web Scraping - as you overhear other players telling stories about others or refuting 

Open Data - Players can choose to reveal their own personal information cards in exchange for digital cash. The fixed rate for revealing any PII card as Open Data is 3 Ƀ coins (bitcoins)

### Game Setup

Set the board out on the table. You are very good at following directions.
Shuffle each of the 3 sets of cards:
Personally Identifiable Information cards (110)
Data cards (22)
Story cards (25)
Place the Data cards and Story cards on the board
Create your Bitcoin Blockchain (Bank) consisting of Bitcoin tokens on the side of the board, along side your repository of WIN/FAIL tokens and Dataset Claim tokens
Each player begins with 5 randomized Personal Identification Cards to represent their persona and earns 12 Ƀ tokens (Bitcoins) for their Startup. They are also given a Data Warehouse (notebook) to record any data they collect about other players.
Now you’re ready to play!


## First Round:

#### Auction:

The auction is to proceed as quickly as possible. One player will flip over a Data card and the auction will begin.

Any interested players shout out their bid amount while placing the corresponding amount of Bitcoins on the game board. If the top bids are tied, the first party to escalate their bid amount wins.

The winner of each auction takes their winning Data card and places it on the table in front of them. They place the winning amount of Bitcoins into the Blockchain.

The process is repeated until four data sets have been auctioned.

#### Data Collection:

Going clockwise around the board, the winner of each data set auction asks if any of the other players have a PII card from their winning Data Set.

Players with any matching PII cards must show the card to the winner of the auction, and the winner records the findings in their Data Warehouse (spiral notebook).

#### Storytelling Session:

A story card is drawn and the players must decide if they can tell a story based on the information they have about other players. 
Each player places a hand in the middle and reveals a thumbs up or thumbs down to show whether or not they plan to tell a story that round. 

The first player to tell a story begins by saying which player they intend to tell a story about. 

The storyteller then uses the personal data they have acquired about that person to tell a convincing story based on the story card prompt. 

The subject of the story has a chance to refute the story based on the other PII in their hand. 

The other three players then vote using the thumbs up/thumbs down method to accept or reject the refutation. 

If the subject can not refute the story or their refutation is not accepted, the storyteller earns a win token for the board and 5 Ƀ coins (Bitcoins). The subject gets a fail token.

If the subject can successfully refute the story, they get a win token but no additional Ƀ coins (Bitcoins). The storyteller gets a fail token. 


##### Selling Your Data and Opening Your Data:

At this point, players may opt to sell their PII for additional Ƀ coins.

##### Right of First Refusal (only relevant after first round):

A player who has previously purchased a data set may ask if any players have subsequently received new PII cards from their purchased data sets. They must offer a fair price for each card. It is up to the holder of the PII card to accept or reject the offer.

Subsequently, if someone wishes to sell a PII card from a sold data set, it must first be offered to the holder of that data set card, before being sold to another player at a negotiated price, or released as Open Data (below).

##### Open Data:

A player may opt to release their PII as Open Data. That player will announce the contents of their card and place it face up on the table in front of them.

Releasing a PII card as Open Data is always worth 3 Ƀ coins.

## Subsequent Rounds:

## End of the Game
The game continues until all of the data sets have been auctioned off and a final round has been played. 
At the end of the final round, players tally win tokens minus fail tokens to determine the final score. 
The player with the highest score wins. 
Everyone else loses. But at least they get easy photo sharing!
